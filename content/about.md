Iâ€™m Tommy, an Undergraduate Student at the [Czech Technical University](https://cvut.cz/en), Prague at the [Faculty of Information Technology](https://fit.cvut.cz/en).

The focal point of my computer science studies is data engineering and analytics. I believe that a profound understanding of data is essential, and it is worth grasping a deep comprehension of technologies that utilize them.

I have a special interest in mathematical concepts in data-related sciences. My focus lies in gaining a profound understanding of theoretical principles in statistics applied in traditional machine learning."
