Iâ€™m Tommy, an Undergraduate Student at the [Czech Technical University](https://cvut.cz/en), Prague at the [Faculty of Information Technology](https://fit.cvut.cz/en).

The focal point of my computer science studies is data engineering and analytics. I believe that proper understanding of data is essential, and it is worth getting a solid grasp of technologies that utilize them. Being especially interested in mathematical concepts I focus on achieving a deep comprehension of theoretical principles in statistics applied in traditional machine learning.
