## Introduction

This analysis explores the distribution of GDP among European countries in 2014, measured in euros per capita at market prices. It uses statistical methods such as linear regression and its variants, tests for normality and homogeneity, ANOVA, VIF, and model-submodel testing. The study identifies the most influential indicators that model GDP effectively.

### Conclusion

This streamlined approach effectively captures GDP dynamics with high accuracy, demonstrating the model's robustness and reliability across various economic conditions. Therefore, focusing on earnings and employment levels provides a solid foundation for understanding and modeling GDP fluctuations.
