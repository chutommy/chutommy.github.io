## Introduction

This analysis explores the impact of arm bone length on the survival of sparrows during winter storms. It uses statistical methods such as distribution function estimation, parameter estimation, simulation, confidence interval calculation, mean value testing, and equality of means testing to investigate the relationship between arm bone length and sparrow survival. The primary objective is to determine whether arm bone length influences sparrow survival during winter storms.

### Conclusion

The dataset used in the analysis consists of arm bone lengths of 59 adult male sparrows, with 24 recorded as deceased and 35 as survivors.

The analysis reveals a significant association between arm bone length and sparrow survival. Sparrows with longer arm bones tend to have higher survival rates during winter storms. Additionally, statistical modeling suggests a normal distribution best fits the observed data.
