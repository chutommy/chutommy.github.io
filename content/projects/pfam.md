This scientific project develops an interpretable model for classifying protein sequences into the most common protein families found in the UniProt Knowledgebase. The study employs and compares various machine learning techniques, such as k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and random forests.

The comprehensive analysis and detailed implementation can be accessed through the following link:
